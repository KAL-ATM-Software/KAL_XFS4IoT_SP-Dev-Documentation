# KAL’s XFS4IoT SP-Dev

Welcome to XFS4IoT framework documentation.

KAL’s XFS4IoT SP-Dev is an open source implementation of the revolutionary new XFS version 4 global standard. It is ready for the IoT era and paves the way for a cloud-based, secure, OS-agnostic ATM industry.

This pioneering framework will enable hardware manufacturers and vendors to quickly create XFS4IoT SPs and offers numerous benefits. As well as being OS-agnostic, it is multivendor and works with hardware from multiple vendors, providing banks with greater choice, enhanced security and lower costs.

## Becoming involved in the SP-Dev project
Hardware and software vendors, test software suppliers and application developers are all invited to join a working group to help develop the new framework, which will be available under the MIT open source license.
