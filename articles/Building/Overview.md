# Building SP-Dev Overview

The SP-Dev project consists of the [SP-Dev Framework](https://github.com/KAL-ATM-Software/KAL_XFS4IoT_SP-Dev) and the [SP-Dev Samples](https://github.com/KAL-ATM-Software/KAL_XFS4IoT_SP-Dev-Samples)

All projects in the SP-Dev Framework are available on [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/KAL-ATM-Software). It is not required to build the SP-Dev Framework locally.
